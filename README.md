**ScenicRules** is an autonomous driving benchmark designed to evaluate systems against complex, multi-objective specifications in diverse driving contexts. It integrates the following key features:

- **Multi-Objective Specification**: Supports the formalization of conflicting driving objectives and explicit priority relations using the [Rulebook](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09355) framework.
- **Abstract Scenario Representation**: Leverages the [Scenic](https://scenic-lang.org/) probabilistic programming language to model driving contexts in an expressive, compact, and interpretable manner.

Please refer to our [documentation](https://scenicrules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation instructions, tutorials, and more details about ScenicRules. ScenicRules was originally designed and implemented by Kevin Kai-Chun Chang, Ekin Beyazit, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Tichakorn Wongpiromsarn, and Sanjit A. Seshia.
